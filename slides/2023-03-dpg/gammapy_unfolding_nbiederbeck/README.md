# Unfolding the Crab Nebula Flux with Gammapy

In spectral analyses of astrophysical gamma-ray sources typically a flux model is fitted.
Unfolding has the advantage over fitting that it is model independent and correctly includes all known detector effects.
Gammapy is a widely used open-source Python package for gamma-ray astronomy, but is lacking unfolding functionality.
In this talk we present the implementation of unfolding in Gammapy and
its application to joint flux unfolding of the Crab Nebula using public data of multiple Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes.
